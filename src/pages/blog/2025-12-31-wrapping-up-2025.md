Sooooo let's get straight to the point: 2025 was quite a big year full of events. It wasn't the best, nor the worst, just somewhere "in-between". I don't know where to start, but there have been both positive and negative points that I do wanna go through

# A different persona
As a background, [back in 2024](2024-07-23-a-new-era) I realized *Lynxmic* no longer felt like myself, so I decided to separate my online identity from the tech YT channel of the same name I've been running since 2016.

***And just like that was how the online persona Clyron came to life.*** The foundations were laid out basically for what was gonna be next. I was quite content with it but the kicker was that it only really fixed part of the problem.
It was always more meant as something ""temporary"" as I didn't have better ideas for names and I've been in the process of *figuring out who I actually am*, experimenting with various ideas overtime <small>(such as an Original Character/OC)</small>.

**In the end I settled on *KayAurora***. Or, for short you can call me Aurie or Kay, or even Amethyst which is the name I'm currently using on social media, all work~ >w<

For the branding, I ended up putting together something minimalist per se, that is simple but professional-looking at the same time, with a sleek color pallete. The outcome ended up SO good I find myself using it for a while from now on:

I'm not that much of a creative person when it comes to design, so that'll have to do.

So right now I am at a point where I am satisfied with my current online identity and can say that *hey! thats actually me!!*

In fact one thing I've been realizing from the process of "figuring things out" <small>(which my online identity reflects)</small> is that ***my personality went increasingly "girly" over time.*** Though there's definitely still a road along the way until the real answer to *what's actually going on in this matter*. For the moment I've been labelling myself *genderfluid*.

# Online Recap
## YouTube
### The state of Lynxmic
**I've ran the Lynxmic project since 2016.** 9 years.
1,500+ subs from over 300,000+ views and counting, with a catalog of more than 400+ Lynxmic videos/streams in total 
<small>(on both main and 2nd channels, including content that was since unlisted/privated/deleted)</small>

It used to be all fun while it lasted, even my screenshot archives prove **I used to have loads of fun messing around with Virtual Machines** in the first few years of the Lynxmic project.
*Though overtime it was starting to get clear for me that my passion has been dwindling after all this time :(*

My motivation and interest just wasn't really there anymore. YouTube has changed substantially this entire time.

One thing is that once your channel is picked up by the algorithm, **you have to do *anything* to keep the channel back on track so that the algorithm keeps recommending it to new people.**
Video ideas <small>(that guaranteedly don't flop!)</small> aren't easy to come up with and you have to maintain a consistent enough upload schedule. And this is in no way specific to my channel at all, I've seen others talk about it as well.

Though sometimes you *can* even have the most random video picked up by the algorithm, *if you're lucky enough as a small channel*. I've seen such videos occasionally come up in my YouTube recommended. Not even Shorts, *normal* long-form videos. YouTube's algorithm is just very *(and I mean very!)* random.

***Lynxmic went down from mostly >2K views per video one after another to flops after flops.*** The [3rd-party apps on OS/2 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6mzTY9Zryw) <small>(the last of 2024)</small> only got just over 440 views as of writing, as opposed to [the video before it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqo1wPm_hic) where I casually revisited the VM of an old series of mine <small>(2.5k+ views)</small>. Most Lynxmic videos since the OS/2 only had <1k views per video.

*I simply just did not have the energy anymore to constantly push out new videos*, so I told myself "*that's it*" and stopped uploading any new videos actively after March, except for spontaneous content every now and then. I was getting so sick of life I just wanted a break anyway >_<

### Looking forward
I slowly started coming back to content creation in Fall/Autumn. Despite my dwindling interest for "VM videos" like I once did, I still love doing content creation to an extent ***and still see myself doing this for a long time from now on as I think it's what I know best***.

**I've been part in the team for the [AstroNT](https://www.youtube.com/@AstroNTWorkstation) project**, a brand new tech channel with a similar focus to Lynxmic's, where I've been contributing with my own set of videos.

I've also been making *proper* videos for the [KayAurora channel](https://www.youtube.com/@thekayaurora), starting with [my first YouTuber collab](https://youtu.be/Oum-DvZcY_w) that I previously teased in October 2024 but which was delayed. I had several other videos planned but they were either cancelled like mid-way or just I never happened to do them

2025 was definitely not my year when it comes to me making videos <small>(that title still goes to 2024~)</small>
I cannot guarantee or promise anything but I wanna try to push more videos in 2026. Not just videos, I wanna get in other projects as well.

## Website
***This website is now completely different from what it used to be at the start of the year.***
[In February](2025-02-09-i-have-rewritten-this-website), I switched the website over from Jekyll to Astro and gave it a whole new look replacing the previous ""Win2000-style design"" which was quite awful imho.
<small>(also 4 months in the making, just like with the YTber collab, mostly due to procrastination)</small>

I initally went with Tailwind for the frontend but then later dropped it in July to give myself full control over the CSS so I can [make the website work on ancient browsers](2025-07-24-how-low-can-you-go-browser-compatibility) for the funni-

Another thing worth noting is that I finally have **my own 88x31 button(s)**, not only for me but also for some of my projects <small>(as seen in the website homepage)</small>! Pretty cool, right?

*Just like with the KayAurora branding which this website's design incorporates* <small>(unless you're reading this on RSS or the Retro Frontend)</small>, I'm satisfied with the outcome and this current site should stay for a while ^^

## Axeon Network
I figure I should talk about this as well.
At the beginning of the year, we had **LynxPlaza** as the "official Lynxmic Discord Server". However as I moved on from the Lynxmic project this year, ***that server was originally also gonna close at some point***. However the changing landscape of Discord communities at the time led to a change of plans.

So on 30 April, the LynxPlaza server has been rebranded to **Axeon Network**. Basically a return to origins.
<small>(before 2022, the server was known as either Axeon Community or just Axeon)</small>

***But that's not all!*** Axeon Network has been becoming more than just being that average Discord community. Other projects came under this umbrella, such as the **MidoriMC** Minecraft Server <small>(initially AxeonMC for a short time, later shut down after a few months)</small>, and since September **[KuroWiki](https://axeon-network.github.io/kurowiki)** and its underlying engine, Deltari. Oh, and for the first time since 2019, it has [its own website](https://axeon-network.github.io) linking to everything <small>(though pretty rudimentary rn lol, that is to be worked on)</small>.

Back to the server, it just had its **8th anniversary** since it was opened on 28 December 2017, which I can now safely say I have reasons to believe it's one of the older still-surviving 'tech' Discord Servers <small>(it was always described as a server where you can talk about anything, but tech had always been the dominant topic)</small>, and personally I'm glad to be owning a server *this old and for so long* :D

Overall for what it ended up being, it has been a success. For its size it has been quite an active community this year, *so at the very least I still did something in 2025*

# The future.
Let's start with the basic stuff: **my 2026 resolutions**.
That's right, *my resolution is 1920x1080!*

Okay, okay, jokes aside my resolutions are pretty simple: **learn and try out new things** and **try to get out of my comfort zone**. And of course, *don't procrastinate again and again and again* like I did this year. How far will I go? I don't know.

In my section in the [last wrapping up year post](2024-12-31-wrapping-up-2024) where I was talking about my "2025 resolutions", I was mostly pointing at YouTube-related stuff. About 2026 though? I have no concrete idea.

As I previously said in my YouTube section, I wanna properly lock in and **get back to making videos actively** <small>(eventually try out a new style for the KayAurora channel, there have been some thoughts in my mind about it)</small>, **as well as start some more side projects** to have my portfolio more complete. What *side projects* though is a question that remains to be answered in 2026.

As for the "comfort zone" part, in the way of addressing this there is one main obstacle: **social anxiety**. This is something I'd like to try to overcome in 2026.
In fact, **my mental health this year hasn't been the greatest it has been** compared to other years with everything that happened IRL with all their circumstances, though I've been thankfully recovering as of late!

What doesn't help is my current living situation which isn't the best. It's not the *worst*, it's just *not adequate enough for my preference*. A *truly* distraction-free environment would be nice to have and of absolute help, but at the moment that still feels like pretty far on the horizon.

Remember that everywhere you look there's an increased cost of living, which leads us to another thing that defined the year: *the AI boom*.
I had a blog post planned about it which I ended up abandoning <small>(and there's also a lot to debate on this!)</small>, but ***AI is being shoved everywhere, even in the most unnecessary places***. Companies nowadays just love AI way too much to the point it's overhyped, simply because it gives them profit! All we can do is if/when the AI bubble bursts, we grab our popcorns and watch as everything happens, like literally. It's not gonna end well.

Oh, and lastly, if it isn't obvious by now, **2026 is the year the Lynxmic project turns 10 years old** <small>(channel created 5 December 2016)</small>. I plan some special Lynxmic content to celebrate, so look forward to that~

# Closing thoughts
So there it is. Yet another year passed.
2025 wasn't the most interesting year, but for sure it brought more memories.

What else left to say anymore? For the final time this year, thanks for reading till the end and, take care! <3 Hopefully 2026 will be better.
And of course I couldn't forget, Happy New Year to those of y'all who are already in 2026 as of the time of publishing!
