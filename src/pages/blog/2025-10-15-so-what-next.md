Last April I announced that I was mostly stopping uploading new content on my [Lynxmic](https://youtube.com/lynxmic) YouTube channel due to dwindling motivation and interest, with the exception of the [Windows 10 EOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c9FCPeW-oA) video and other fillers uploaded at spontaneous times.

Fast forward 6 months I pretty much changed in a way or two idk, but the matter is that I.. changed. Though there's still a long way ahead and I'm here to give an insight to what's gonna happen next!

# My future as a content creator
So with the whole Windows 10 EOS thing over, the question is.. ***what's next?***\
While my passion to mess around with Virtual Machines a lot is no longer there at least as much, **I still enjoy content creation and I still see myself doing it for a long time**, *and so that's what i'm gonna talk about first*

I've got several options on the table, and the first one (currently the most likely one) would be to start actively posting content on my personal KayAurora channel.\
To start with I was initially thinking of posting a "variety" (well not really but you get the point) of videos mostly focused on whatever comes in my mind that's usually seen on the screen of a tech device. I currently already got 1-2 videos planned for this channel, one of them being already a work-in-progress (*editing in Kdenlive as a DaVinci Resolve user*)

Just in case, I set up a spare YT channel of mine to be **an "extras channel" of the KayAurora channel** to upload all those random shitposts on instead - if ya want to check it out and subscribe, [here](https://www.youtube.com/@KayAuroraPlus).\
No more new shitposts/lower quality content will be uploaded on the main channel at the moment. The existing ones <small>(except notable ones)</small> have been unlisted to clean up my channel, but I've put them in a separate playlist instead so you can keep watching them~

*But*, what if the channel topic I end up doing after all is "tech" and is similar to the tech video formula I used to do on the Lynxmic channel? In that case, another option is to just use that channel for those. If that is eventually what happens, I'm considering a channel revamp to go with it

**So I will one day fully return to creating content**, just not under the same style of content I've done in the *recent* past.\
As much as I'd like to share more of my plans, I'm gonna choose to *wait until the stuff actually becomes a reality*.

# Other projects
In addition to new videos, ***I also wanna Actually start working on other side projects too.***\
For the longest time, my side projects were always either Discord Bots <small>(mostly back in 2017-19)</small> or my own personal website (or sometimes even websites for the Discord bots or servers I used to publicly operate in the past), but I absolutely want to change that.

I have some plans here and there too, but just like with the content creation plans I'm holding off on talking more about it *until the right moment comes*

Though as to *when the right time comes* I have no idea. I procrastinate A LOT, tasks are often either kept delayed or they take hours to make not because they're that hard, but due to how much I keep distracting myself. I need a distraction-free environment but in the home I currently live I only have limited options.\
Don't know where to start, but I am gonna try my best. Not ruling out anything at this point, if needed I might even reduce my social media activity for the time being

**I'm definitely changing up my priorities from here on.** I'm gonna try to not work on this website (kaywebsite) you're currently <small>(or not, if you're on RSS)</small> reading this blog post on as much.\
Quite frankly, this was the only thing I seriously worked on and got to a finished state aside from any filler YouTube video etc. I kept switching things up around again and again and again but at this moment the website is good enough *and nothing really needs change*. There are some "nice to have" features and improvements planned but I prefer other more worthwhile projects have a bigger priority for me than releasing new personal website versions every single month.

So, again, to clarify, *I'm not gonna discontinue this website or anything, just that I won't work on it as much.* Expect only one more major update to this website at most this year.
