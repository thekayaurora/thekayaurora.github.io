After like over 3 months of off-and-on development (since I procrastinated a lot), I'm finally here announcing a new iteration of clyron.is-a.dev.

This is a complete rewrite, doing away with that Jekyll+pure CSS with "Windows 2000-esque" design introduced in August 2024 in favor of something more cleaner.

Now I have been using Jekyll, a static site generator developed with Ruby for all my websites since 2021. Jekyll worked well enough, it suited my needs very well, but sometimes you gotta explore new things too.

When I first chose Jekyll, it was at a time when all I wanted was a blog that wasn't on any of the major popular blogging websites (eg. Blogger, WordPress, Medium), and I needed something to handle all the blog stuff more easily. Over time though what used to be just a blog evolved into an all-round personal website

So with that all over the way, plus the fact that:
* I'm not familiar enough with the Ruby programming language used by Jekyll, nor I wouldn't really want to learn it
* Over time I've been liking the Win2000-esque design less and less, with absolutely lack of interest whatsoever in finishing it

I have rebuilt this website from scratch.

## What's new?
This time I chose Astro as my site framework and Tailwind CSS as the CSS framework.

Astro from the beginning seemed pretty interesting to look at (and I'm still interested in looking into it more and take advantage of every feature)

About Tailwind CSS, it's pretty much exactly what I need from a CSS framework. Essentially like Bulma but without any pre-built CSS elements since I often have a tendency to just come up with my own design for many aspects anyways. All it consists of is some `class` elements that effectively make CSS easier to work with. I'm not the best in the world at explaining things, but I hope this explains it well enough

For the design of this new website itself, I chose to kinda go back to the "legacy" and go with a design rather similar to my old website lynxmic.github.io (or sometimes called the LynxWebsite)... except I can say it's of course better... at least by 1%

Overall I like how this turned out, there have been some ups and downs but after 3 months of like procrastination, being overall demotivated, etc the usual, it's finally here. There are still some features and adjustments I'd like to roll out sometime later but for now the base thing is finished enough to finally replace the old website - otherwise it would have taken much longer

I do wish I was more creative with design stuff, the current design iteration wasn't the first of the Astro rewrite website. Beforehand I did experiment with several other designs, from all this was the best I could think of

Probably the only disadvantage of going back from pure CSS to using a CSS framework is that the site is no longer being rendered properly on older browsers. This is not a big deal since most-if-not-all people will use a modern browser but I always thought this ability was cool to have

The old site is still available at [clyron.is-a.dev/legacy-site](https://clyron.is-a.dev/legacy-site) for the time being, I may or may not eventually make a cooler retro site for other browsers idk, but for now the old site will have to do
